As I went about looking for a name for my new project, a cleaner, more flexible, and more semantic version of materialize, I read on @codinghorror's blog to name a project after Ikea products. Here's what I found:

- HEKTAR
- ÅRSTID
- ALÄNG
- KLABB
- STRANNE
- HOLMÖ
- DUDERÖ
- MAGNARP
- SOLLEFTEÅ
- NOT
- RESELE
- BÖJA
- REGOLIT
- ELDSHULT
- INGALUND
- NYFORS
- ÄLVÄNGEN
and many more. I mean *seriously*! Who names their product 'NOT'?
