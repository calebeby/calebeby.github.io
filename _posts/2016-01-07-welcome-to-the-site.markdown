Hi!
I'm Caleb.
I've wanted to make a website for a while, with guides and a blog, and I needed to make a website for my programming class at school, so here it is.

I plan on making programming guides occasionally because I think that the internet needs more resources for beginning programmers.

This site is built with [Jekyll][jekyll], styled with [Materialize CSS][materializecss], and hosted on [Github Pages][gh-pages]


[jekyll]:http://jekyllrb.com/
[materializecss]:http://materializecss.com/
[gh-pages]:https://github.com/calebeby/calebeby.github.io
